# NixOS Configuration Migration Plan

## Current Status Analysis

This repository shows an evolution from traditional dotfiles to a NixOS-based configuration with the following components:

1. **Traditional Dotfiles (2015-2022)**: The repository began as a collection of bash, zsh, tmux, and emacs configurations.

2. **NixOS Main Configuration (2022-2023)**: 
   - `flake.nix` at the root directory configuring a system named "classic-laddie"
   - Home-manager setup for user environment
   - Specialized configurations for development tools (emacs, git, i3, etc.)

3. **Separate Basic Configuration (2023-2024)**: 
   - `nix-basic/` directory with a simpler NixOS configuration 
   - Used for setting up a home server with media drives and tailscale
   - Most recent development was in this area

## Migration Goals

Based on the repository content, the goal appears to be creating a unified NixOS configuration that works across:
- A NixOS Linux server in the basement (classic-laddie)
- Multiple laptops (ChromeOS, Mac) with shared configurations where possible

## Issues and Next Steps

### Issue 1: Unify Configurations
- **Title**: Merge nix-basic and root configurations
- **Description**: The repository currently has two separate NixOS configurations. Consolidate these into a single flake with multiple hosts.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Create common modules for shared functionality
  - Extract host-specific configurations
  - Implement a unified flake structure with multiple outputs

### Issue 2: Create Cross-Platform Strategy
- **Title**: Implement cross-platform support for multiple devices
- **Description**: Develop a strategy for sharing configurations between NixOS Linux, Mac (using nix-darwin), and ChromeOS.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Add nix-darwin as an input to the flake
  - Create platform-specific and shared home-manager configurations
  - Test on different devices

### Issue 3: Update Dependencies
- **Title**: Update all flake dependencies
- **Description**: The flake.lock files show outdated dependencies from early 2024 and earlier.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Run `nix flake update` to get latest versions
  - Test configuration with updated dependencies
  - Fix any incompatibilities

### Issue 4: Implement Proper Documentation
- **Title**: Create comprehensive documentation
- **Description**: Add detailed documentation on the configuration structure, deployment process, and host-specific setup.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Create a docs/ directory with markdown files
  - Document each module's purpose and configuration options
  - Add examples for adding new hosts

### Issue 5: Improve CI/Testing
- **Title**: Enhance GitHub Actions workflows
- **Description**: Build on the newly added CI workflows to test configurations across platforms.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Add matrix testing for different NixOS versions
  - Implement automatic deployment testing
  - Add Darwin build tests for macOS support

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Consolidation**
   - Merge nix-basic into the main flake structure
   - Create proper host profiles

2. **Phase 2: Cross-Platform Support**
   - Add nix-darwin support for Mac
   - Create ChromeOS compatibility layer

3. **Phase 3: Modernization**
   - Update all dependencies
   - Improve module structure
   - Enhance error handling and robustness

4. **Phase 4: Documentation and CI**
   - Complete documentation
   - Enhance CI/CD pipelines
